title: Liskov principle violation via Liskov principle violation via complete domain change
description: >
 Redefinition of method f in object derived causes complete change of the function input domain.
 The domain changes from (-inf, 9) to (9, inf). 
 The defects manifests as the domain did not just decrease in size but became non-overlapping with the original one.
features:
  - inheritance
  - overriding
  - method
  - polymorphism
