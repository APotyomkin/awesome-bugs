title: Mutual recursion in a chain of inheritance
description: >
  Mutual recursion occurs in the inheritance chain when adding
  a new method m in the first derived class and overriding method n
  in the last class of the inheritance chain
features:
  - inheritance
  - overriding
  - method
  - polymorphism
