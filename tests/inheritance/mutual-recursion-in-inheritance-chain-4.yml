title: Mutual recursion in a chain of inheritance
description: >
  Mutual recursion occurs in the inheritance chain when adding
  a new method o in the first derived class (which calls m)
  and overriding method n in the last class of the inheritance
  chain (which calls o)
features:
  - inheritance
  - overriding
  - method
  - polymorphism
