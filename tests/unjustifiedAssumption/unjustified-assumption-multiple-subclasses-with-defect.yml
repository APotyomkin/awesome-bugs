title: Unjustified assumption in two participants of the inheritance chain
description: >
 Here, two members of the inheritance chain have an unjustified assumption about method m.
 As a result, methods k and m of the osnova class contain a defect. 
features:
  - inheritance
  - overriding
  - method
  - polymorphism
