title: Unjustified assumption in presence of recursion
description: >
 In this test case the problem manifests due to changes in preconditions of method n after redefinition.
 The redefinition also causes the methods to become mutually recursive.

features:
  - inheritance
  - overriding
  - method
  - polymorphism
