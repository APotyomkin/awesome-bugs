title: Unjustified assumption in an inheritance chain with two not referentially transparent methods.
description: >
 Here methods g and g2 of the object parent have unjustified assumptions about method f.
 As a result, the redefinition of method f in object child causes the properties of these methods to change. 
features:
  - inheritance
  - overriding
  - method
  - polymorphism
